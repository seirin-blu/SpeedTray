A tray mount 3D printable case for an integrated KS-33 QAZ

Designed to be used with M2x4mm machine screws like [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MPK3N63/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

The screw holes are currently 1.8mm. You may need to adjust the size to be 1.6mm before printing. 

This has been tested with FDM printing only. If you want to print in SLA, edit the holes so that they are around 1.8mm ID.
